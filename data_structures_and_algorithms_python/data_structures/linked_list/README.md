# Linked Lists

Ih this project, we created a data structure called **Singly-Linked-List** in Python. We used two classes, _Node_ and _LinkedList_.

**Node** included the following:

    1. `value`.
    2. `next`.

**LinkedList** included the following:

    _Attributes_:
         1. `head`.

    _methods_:
        1. `insert`: takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
        2. `includes`: takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.
        3. `__str__`: returns a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as: `"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"`
        3. `append`: dds a new node with the given value to the end of the list.
        4. `insertBefore`: adds a new node with the given newValue immediately before the first value node.
        5. `insertAfter`: adds a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node.
        6. `deleteValue`:  delete a node with the given value from the linked list.

**User acceptance tests** are included with the following test cases:

    1. Can successfully instantiate an empty linked list.
        * list = LinkedList() -> None
    2. Can properly insert into the linked list.
        * list.insert(3) -> { 3 } -> NULL
    3. The head property will properly point to the first node in the linked list.
        * print (list.head.value) -> 3
    4. Can properly insert multiple nodes into the linked list.
        * list.insert(5)
        * list.insert(7)
        * list.insert(9)
    5. Will return true when finding a value within the linked list that exists.
        * list.includes(5) -> True
    6. Will return false when searching for a value in the linked list that does not exist.
        * list.includes(11) -> False
    7. Can properly return a collection of all the values that exist in the linked list.
        * print(list) -> "{ 9 } -> { 7 } -> { 5 } -> { 3 } -> NULL"

    8. Can successfully add a node to the end of the linked list.
    9. Can successfully add multiple nodes to the end of a linked list.
    10. Can successfully insert a node before a node located i the middle of a linked list.
    11. Can successfully insert a node before the first node of a linked list.
    12. Can successfully insert after a node in the middle of the linked list.
    13. Can successfully insert a node after the last node of the linked list.
    14. Can successfully delete a value in the middle of the linked list.
    15. Can successfully delete a the first value of the linked list.
    16. Can successfully delete a the last value of the linked list.
