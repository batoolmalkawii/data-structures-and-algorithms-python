# Reverse an Array
Challenge1 that requires reversing an array.

## Challenge
Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.

## Approach & Efficiency
Approach: I used a **for in** loop that iterates through the array elements. Then, adds the element to the beginning of a new array using the **arr.insert** function 
Complexity: ***O(n)***, where n is the number of elements in the array.
